Do you have a passion for the CSS3 grid system as much as for elegant typography? Then send us your portfolio today and join the ranks of Reach Robotics.**\r\n\r\nWe are looking for an intrepid web designer to join us in shaping the future of a unified MekaMon web experience. Our first game, MekaMon - a hybrid robotics AR gaming platform - encompasses a myriad of distinct web products that we wish to integrate and grow. From the online shop to the sister webapp Mekacademy Online, including the community site or the Swift playgrounds, our aim is to build a coherent web footprint. Much of it will be achieved through our UI kit as well as a carefully crafted selection of resilient layout templates, all converging to provide a unique MekaMon UX.\r\n\r\nThis is where you get in. We are in need of someone with a particular talent designing great UI/UX for the web. Proficiency with the latest CSS miracles is fundamental, as well as knowing your way around a typical modern front-end project (npm, grunt, webpack, sass, git).\r\n\r\n**About Reach Robotics**\r\n\r\nReach Robotics is the company behind MekaMon - The four-legged augmented reality battle mech recently launched with Apple across the UK, US and EU. Using robotics and augmented reality, we’re creating unique experiences that aim to entertain, inspire and educate.\r\n\r\nBased a five-minute walk from Bristol Parkway train station and with excellent links to the M32 / M4 (plus private parking), we’re rapidly hiring across all teams to help realise our products full potential and shape the future of augmented reality entertainment.\r\n\r\nWe’re proud of the people first culture we’ve created at Reach - We're passionate about the experiences we're creating and love what we do.\r\n\r\nFriday afternoons are dedicated to stepping away from the desk to game and work on projects outside our normal scope.

You will be entrusted with shaping our web products and designing a UI kit of web components. We expect you to be able to produce and iterate different types of prototypes and wireframes, storyboards and mockups. Applications such as Sketch, Adobe (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign), InVision, should not be strange to you.\r\n\r\nIn terms of technology, you should be quite familiar with HTML5. However, your forte here must be CSS, namely in the form of SASS or Less. Being familiar with other technologies, such as npm, grunt, webpack and git is also desirable.\r\n\r\nSo, fundamentally, you will be called to put the money where your mouth is, when it comes to your design solutions. And for that you will require a certain mastery of CSS. We also expect maintainable and reusable stylesheets, organised semantically according to the components they refer to.\r\n\r\n**What we are looking for**\r\n\r\nThe key requirements we’re looking for in your application are\r\n\r\n- 5+ years of industry experience designing responsive webapps or strongly branded sites (portfolio)\r\n- Strong understanding of UI and UX principles, with demonstrable experience taking concepts through to completion\r\n- Demonstrable ability producing wireframes, storyboards and fast prototypes (using tools such as Adobe InDesign, Sketch, Balsamiq, InVision)\r\n- Acceptance of the mobile-first credo.

Your HTML5 & CSS3 skills will shine as you show off optimization and code quality when resolving bugs and issues when they come up. You'll also work at designing and developing better user experiences and measuring the effect on those through A/B tests.\r\n\r\nWe practice good coding standards, we build for the future, and we don't believe in cowboy coding or working in a bubble. We're looking for thinkers ... with talent. We don’t need employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What you'll be doing day-to-day\r\n\r\n* Writing code with a focus on performance, speedy page load times, improving conversion rates\r\n* Building sites and implementing redesigns, designed in Illustrator/Sketch, on our WordPress-based sites\r\n* Coding features for our sites (both through WP Themes and not) using HTML5/CSS/PHP/JS\r\n* Designing and developing better user experiences and measuring the effect on those through A/B tests\r\n* Future-proofing our sites with maintenance fixes, updating features, and rolling out responsive, mobile-friendly platforms\r\n* Conversing, committing, and delivering via Asana/Slack/GitHub/email (in whatever order that is)\r\n* Exploring new technologies/tools for finding solutions to new (and old) problems\r\n* Optimizing conversions with A/B testing and Visual Website Optimizer and Google Optimize (yep ... important enough to list here and not with the Pluses below)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Application Architecture (things you'll HAVE to know)\r\n\r\n* Heavy PHP Experience (you love PHP so much you got excited when null coalescing operators were added to PHP7)\r\n* _We’re serious about the PHP part._ We’re not talking about getting by with WordPress-PHP. We’re not a typical WP Theme shop, and you’ll have a hard time keeping up if you aren’t confident in your abilities.\r\n* Rock-solid, working, current knowledge of the in and outs, ups and downs of WordPress\r\n* Sass, Bourbon, etc. (or other CSS pre-processor)\r\n* CSS Frameworks (Bourbon/Neat, Twitter Bootstrap, 960.gs, Foundation, etc... we roll our own, btw)\r\n* JavaScript & jQuery skills\r\n* Experience with build and package management tools like Gulp, Grunt, NPM, Bower, etc\r\n* Structured Data (gotta satisfy the Googles)\r\n* Advanced understanding of all the cool buzzwords... SEO, Web-standards, accessibility and usability concepts, information architecture, UX & UI design (heavy on the UX)\r\n* Good communication skills & a great can-do attitude (We’re totally serious about this one.)\r\n* A GitHub account or experience with other version control (SVN, CVS, etc. ... but git/gh is where it's at)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tech Stack\r\n\r\nhtml5, css3, javascript, jquery, php, wordpress, git, github, node.js, angular, react, vagrant, npm, bower, bundler, headless, gulp, sass, composer\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pluses\r\n\r\n* Chris Coyier is a hero of yours.\r\n* Headless CMS and static site generators intrigue you.\r\n* You know the entire CanIUse library inside and out.\r\n* You want to teach as much as learn.\r\n* You have a pixel-perfect design eye with Photoshop/Illustrator or Sketch skills to match. It’s going to come in super-handy.\r\n* You read sites like SmashingMagazine.com and actually put tutorials into practice.\r\n* You’ve attended a WordCamp, Meetup, or other industry conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Human Environment\r\n\r\n* Centrally located in downtown Houston, free employee parking\r\n* Coed work environment, casual dress\r\n* Cool office perks (free sodas/Topo Chico/coffee, snacks, etc.)\r\n* Generous salary considerations & full benefits\r\n\r\n\r\n## What We Value\r\n\r\nWe love to work as a team but office hours are flexible. Producing is more important than meeting a \"9 to 5\" schedule. We understand there are moments when you need to isolate yourself to concentrate so working from home is permitted and encouraged. We like to have a good time and minimize stress with good in-office coffee, lounge/reading time and regular happy hours. We work hard and meet realistic deadlines.
